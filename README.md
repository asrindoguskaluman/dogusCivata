I developed a website for my family's business using a simple HTML and CSS template. The primary goal of this site was to promote our business digitally, provide an easily accessible platform for potential customers, and create a corporate image.

I specifically included the following sections on the website:
Portfolio: A section that visually showcases our business's previously completed projects and product lines.
Location Information: I integrated Google Maps to ensure visitors can easily find our physical address.
Product Groups: Pages that categorize and showcase the products we serve or sell.
Contact: I provided a contact form with a phone number, email address, and social media links, allowing visitors to quickly reach us.

This project aims to both increase the online visibility of our family business and create a reliable and informative resource for customers.
